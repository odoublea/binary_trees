# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

> Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes.
> A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children.
> A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

## Important Terms
### Following are the important terms with respect to tree.

- <strong>Path</strong> − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
- <strong>Root</strong> − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
- <strong>Parent</strong> − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
- <strong>Child</strong> − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
- <strong>Leaf</strong> − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
- <strong>Subtree</strong> − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
- <strong>Visiting</strong> − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
- <strong>Traversing</strong> − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.
- <strong>Levels</strong> − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
- <strong>keys</strong> − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
